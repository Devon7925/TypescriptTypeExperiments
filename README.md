# Pushing Typescript to the Limit
This is going to be a set of examples of using typescript's type system in interesting ways. The goal is to be able to build a set of utility types that can be used to do computation compile time.
## TODO List
Some of these are already done by me or other people, I just need to copy them over. It's also possible that some of these aren't possible.
